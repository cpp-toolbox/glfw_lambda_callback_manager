# glfw_lambda_callback_manager
SUBPROJECT

By default you don't have access to much inside of the regular glfw callbacks, so you are limited to stuffing what you need in the glfw user pointer, for example suppose you want to update the hud when the user types, so you bind into the glfw character callback
